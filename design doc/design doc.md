*Descriptive Stats*

Team Torrey’s Peak used the COVID-19 dataset comprising more than 3500 CBC news articles for our MSBX 5420 team project. This dataset retrieved from kaggle contains the authors, the title, the publish date, the description about the story, the main story and the url. For the start of this project, we wanted a closer look into the descriptive statistics within the dataset. With a goal in mind to focus on the sum of articles over time, we first created a line of code to put the publish dates into the correct date form. Next, we created an index naming this news_2020 to adjust the publish date to January 1, 2020 and created a new column to count how many articles were in each day. Figure A shows the results of the new article count.
